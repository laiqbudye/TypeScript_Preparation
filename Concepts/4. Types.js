What is Type in TS?
  by definition:- easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has.
  value is aything that we assign to a variable. (number, string, boolean, undefined, null)

  var a = 'red';   // a is now a string type which has access to methods like charAt(), length.


Types
1. Primitive types - number, string, boolean, undefined, null, void, symbol
2. Object types - functions, arrays, classes, objects



Why do we care about types?
  - types are used by typescript compiler to analyze our code for errors.
  - allows other devs to understand what values are flowing around our codebase.
