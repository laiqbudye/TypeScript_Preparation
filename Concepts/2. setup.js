to work with typescript we need to setup that first.

  - to install 
    npm i typescript
    
    this installation will give us access to 'tsc' command which stands for typescript compiler.
    
    
    so to convert our typescript (.ts) file into .js file
      - tsc index.ts      // this command will generate index.js file which can be understandable by the browser.
