What is Typescript?
  
  Typescript = Javascript + A type System


What is type system?
  - Helps us to catch errors during development
  - uses 'type annotations' to analyze our code
  - only active during development


here, we need to convert our typescript code into JS as browser does not understand typescript.


      Typescript code           ====>     Typescript Compiler     =====>     Plain old Javascript
 (JS with type annotations)



Writing Typescript is the same as writing Javascript with some "extra documentation".
